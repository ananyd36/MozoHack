# MozoHack
Above is a re-upload of everything that my team and I worked on and developed at the Mozohack 24-Hour Hackathon. This is a working model of our product. 

Instructions:
  * Install and unpack electron inside the /main
  * Open Terminal and run electron using ` npm start`
  * Default logins credentials are:
    * staff@mozohack.com | mozostaff
    * admin@mozohack.com | mozoadmin
    
All codes are equipped with appropriate logs for debug. Deep comments will be added soon.

Email for issues.
